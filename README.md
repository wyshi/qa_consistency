# qa_consistency

We use the [ParlAI](https://parl.ai/) framework for this project. 

## Dialogue-based QA model
We build the QA model with the [DREAM dataset](https://github.com/nlpdata/dream).

## Question Generator
We build the question generator also with the [DREAM dataset](https://github.com/nlpdata/dream).

## Human evaluation
human_evaluation/ contains the scripts to build a Blenderbot using the classifiers.
